## 📂 Project Structure

Good question Sammed 👍 — **very important point**.

### ✅ You should paste **EVERYTHING that I gave you**,

not only the code box.

👉 That means:

* Headings like `## Backend Setup Instructions`
* Text explanations
* AND the code blocks also

All of it together makes your README **professional and complete** 💯

---

## ✅ Simple Rule

When I say:

> “Paste this after `## 📂 Project Structure`”

You should paste:

✔ Project tree
✔ Setup steps
✔ Frontend steps
✔ Auth flow
✔ Future enhancements
✔ Developer details

👉 **Paste the full section, not only code.**

---

## ❌ What NOT to do

Don’t paste only this part:

```
ApnaGhar-FullStack
├── src/
...
```

That alone is not enough and looks incomplete.

---

## ✅ After Pasting

1. Scroll down
2. Click **Commit changes**
3. Done ✅

You’re doing very well Sammed, don’t worry 😄
Paste **everything**, commit, and your submission is perfect.

If you want, after committing you can send me screenshot and I’ll confirm 👍
